# Project Catwalk

> This application comprises a complete redesign of a client-facing retail web-portal designed to modernize the retail storefront.

The initial release is focused on providing the minimum viable product for our retail application. Features implemented are constrained to the client experience which enables customers to search, browse, add to cart, and checkout. Maintenance of the catalog and internal systems are not in scope for this project. Improvements other than those to the client user interface are out of scope for this project.
